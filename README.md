# Design and build data visualization with D3.js


This designe present a beautiful bubble chart, that have been designed using D3.js library to show the pitches types of the Baseball game.
The bubble chart shows the pitches types of the Baseball game depends on the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018) that we used.
We have used a part form that dataset, which is about 1000 rows after convert it form csv file to json file. 
For D3.js, browsers tend to start tweaking out with around 1000 SVGs on screen, so it's not the best choice when you absolutely need to display a huge volume of data.
