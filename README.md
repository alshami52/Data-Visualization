Hello everyone!
My name is Ali Al Shami. I am a master student at University of Colorado at Colorado springs(UCCS).
Me and my advisor professor Rory Lewis have designed this beautiful bubble chart in D3.js library to show the pitches types of the Baseball game.
The bubble chart shows the Pitches types of the Baseball game depends on the dataset that we got it online form https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018.
We have used a part form that dataset, about 1000 rows after convert it form csv file to json file. 
For D3, browsers tend to start tweaking out with around 1000 SVGs on screen, so it's not the best choice when you absolutely need to display a huge volume of data.
So, future work is to use a huge volume of dataset (all dataset) by average sets of data together

Thanks for read this 

Best,

Ali Al Shami
